    <p class="maintext">
        Hey there. I'm Gabriel. <br/> <br/> For  now, I'm a student on the Faculty of Organization and Informatics in Vara≈ædin
        (a small city in northern Croatia).Right now I'm on my 4th year of studies, and my major is Organization of Business Systems.

        This page was primarily imagined as my portfolio page, to show some of my works, and projects that I was involved during college
        and some of my personal ones. Secondarily I'll be using this page as a platform for learning Web development and design.
        <br/>
        Currently I'm learning Web development from a great course hosted on <a href="https://www.udemy.com" target="_blank">Udemy</a>
